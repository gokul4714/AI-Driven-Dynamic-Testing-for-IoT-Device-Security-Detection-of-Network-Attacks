# AI-Driven-Dynamic-Testing-for-IoT-Device-Security-Detection-of-Network-Attacks
This project enhances IoT security using AI-driven dynamic testing. Network attacks are simulated and analyzed using NS-3, and a GNN model is developed and compared with a DDQN model to accurately detect threats like DoS, DDoS, Botnet, and MITM in real time.
